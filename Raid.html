					<h3>The Raid</h3>
					<p>The Leviathin raid is tough. There are three trials who each have their own situations you will need to overcome with our group.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<img src="./Images/Heroic.png">
					<h3>Step One</h3>
					<p>The first step to the raid is to either enter the underbelly or do the flags. To enter the underbelly take the lower stairs at the start and eter a room full of levers. each lever has a number from left to right and there are six levers. Pull the levers in this order: 153246. Doing this will open a wall that you will enter to open the undervelly which can be used to get to each trial. If you do not wish to enter through the underbelly the only other option is to do the flags. You and your group have to find the door with the glowing symbols in front, once you do two guardians will be in charge of going around the map depending on the symbol that is glowing and have to kill the cabal and the mini boss that spawns there. once this is done a flag will spawn that will have to be returned to the original symbol. As this occurs the other four guardians are in charge of defending the symbols as waves of enemies attack them. It will get harder as more flags are brought. Every now and then a psion will spawn that will need to be meleed or else the cabal will be immune to attack. After three flags are collected the door will open and you will be rewarded with a chest. If the guardians fail to protect the flag it will despawn and you will have to collect the flag that was taken again. The chest only rewards you for completing the flags once.</p>

					<h3>The Trials</h3>
					<p>There are three trials that rotate at each weekly reset. Dogs, symbolised by the dog, Gauntlet, symbolised by the Axes, and pools, symbolised by the sun.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">

					<h3>Dogs</h3>
					<p>Dogs will require two people to hold a relic and shoot various flowers that are glowing across the map. After shooting the flower, it is also required that they shoot the cabal that spawns at the various doors around the map. The other four guardians carry a spore around and travel to each flower that is glowing while avoiding the dogs that walk around the map. Once each guardian arrives at the flower the person carring the relic shoots the flower granting the guardians with a buff to boost damage. The goal is to collect the most flowers before the dogs begin to howl. After the dogs start to howl, each guardian will run to a flower that they were assigned to in order to shoot your dog. The more flowers you got the more damage you will do. If any guardian alerts the dogs before they howled they will preceed to howl prematurely and you will have less time to get flowers. After around 30 seconds of shootin your dog you will return to the center of the map where the four guardians picked up the spores or else you will die. At the end all dogs should be killed at the same time.</p>

					<h3>Gauntlet</h3>
					<p>Someone is gonna run in circles and call out the row and the symbol that the red circle is in. Whoever is on the plate of the called out circle shoots the top arrow dpedning on where he is at. If on Dogs or Cups he shoots top. If on sun and or axes... Shoot bottom. Axes and cup work together So axes will shoot bottom for cup and cup will shoot top for axes and visa versa for dogs and sun. After doing this three times everyone wil</p>
