					<h3>The Raid</h3>
				<p>The Leviathin raid is tough. There are three trials who each have their own situations you will need to overcome with our group.</p>

					<h3>Step One</h3>
				<p>The first step to the raid is to either enter the underbelly or do the flags. To enter the underbelly take the lower stairs at the start and eter a room full of levers. each lever has a number from left to right and there are six levers. Pull the levers in this order: 153246. Doing this will open a wall that you will enter to open the undervelly which can be used to get to each trial. If you do not wish to enter through the underbelly the only other option is to do the flags. You and your group have to find the door with the glowing symbols in front, once you do two guardians will be in charge of going around the map depending on the symbol that is glowing and have to kill the cabal and the mini boss that spawns there. once this is done a flag will spawn that will have to be returned to the original symbol. As this occurs the other four guardians are in charge of defending the symbols as waves of enemies attack them. It will get harder as more flags are brought. Every now and then a psion will spawn that will need to be meleed or else the cabal will be immune to attack. After three flags are collected the door will open and you will be rewarded with a chest. If the guardians fail to protect the flag it will despawn and you will have to collect the flag that was taken again. The chest only rewards you for completing the flags once.</p>

				<h3>The Trials</h3>
					<p>There are three trials that rotate at each weekly reset. Dogs, symbolised by the dog, Gauntlet, symbolised by the Axes, and pools, symbolised by the sun.</p>

					<h3>Dogs</h3>
				<p>Dogs will require two people to hold a relic and shoot various flowers that are glowing across the map. After shooting the flower, it is also required that they shoot the cabal that spawns at the various doors around the map. The other four guardians carry a spore around and travel to each flower that is glowing while avoiding the dogs that walk around the map. Once each guardian arrives at the flower the person carring the relic shoots the flower granting the guardians with a buff to boost damage. The goal is to collect the most flowers before the dogs begin to howl. After the dogs start to howl, each guardian will run to a flower that they were assigned to in order to shoot your dog. The more flowers you got the more damage you will do. If any guardian alerts the dogs before they howled they will preceed to howl prematurely and you will have less time to get flowers. After around 30 seconds of shootin your dog you will return to the center of the map where the four guardians picked up the spores or else you will die. At the end all dogs should be killed at the same time.</p>

					<h3>Gauntlet</h3>
				<p>Someone is gonna run in circles and call out the row and the symbol that the red circle is in. Whoever is on the plate of the called out circle shoots the top arrow dpedning on where he is at. If on Dogs or Cups he shoots top. If on sun and or axes... Shoot bottom. Axes and cup work together So axes will shoot bottom for cup and cup will shoot top for axes and visa versa for dogs and sun. After doing this three times everyone wil</p>

					<h3>Pools</h3>
				<p>The four players must move to their assigned plates and step on them simultaneously, gaining the Psionic Protection buff. These are the plate holders. The two middle players will jump onto the middle plate one by one, waiting a moment between them to ensure that each gets a Psionic Protection buff. (It takes a moment to respawn after one player takes it.) Out of the chain pools in front of the two front plates, a Ceremonial Bather. will emerge to attack the plate holders. These are very difficult enemies, and you must kill them quickly. The middle players should go to the Ceremonial Bathers on their specific sides and help the plate holders defeat them. Once players are standing on all five plates, the encounter will begin. Once the Ceremonial Bathers are down, the middle players (Middle) will swap places with the front plate holders (Front). The Front will then run to the middle plate, refresh their buff and head toward the bottom plate of their same side.

Around this time, Ceremonial Bathers should be spawning in the bottom areas. While the Middle holds the front plate, the Front will help with the bottom plate player's (Bottom) Bather. Once that Bather is down, Front will take bottom plate and Bottom will refresh their buff before moving to front plate.

Essentially, you are running an L-shaped relay race between your original plate, the middle and the opposite plate on your assigned side. Each rotation should be done immediately after a Ceremonial Bather has been killed. Middle comes to help kill the Bather and then Front leaves to refresh their buff before helping Bottom kill their Bather. If each Bather doesn't have at least two Guardians fighting it, you are rotating too slowly and putting the solo plate holder in serious danger.</p>

				<h3>Calus</h3>
				<p>When Calus stands up, a legion of Cabal will erupt in waves from the three doors. The first several enemies will be Legionaries, Psions, Phalanxes and War Hounds. Once enough of them have come through, a very powerful Cabal major will enter the arena. (This powerful Cabal will change type each wave but will remain powerful). Have one or two of your teammates use a roaming Super to defeat as many of the powerful Cabal as possible. Calus will also be shooting a giant laser beam at a random raid player. If he's shooting you, hide behind one of the many barriers and shoot enemies from there. Once the room is clear, run around and grab ammo. After a few moments of silence, Calus will clap his hands, teleporting you and your entire Fireteam to a Shadow Realm. The Fireteam will now be on some kind of horribly jagged slide, and at the end there is a giant, spiritual version of Calus' head. Within the dark realm, Puncher should run forward, jump over the low barrier and grab one of the three teleportation orbs. This orb will send you back to the throne room. Assuming the other two Punchers made it to their designated orbs, there should now be three of you back where you started. Similar to running as a Shooter in the Gauntlet, Punchers must defend themselves from enemies while also communicating with their counterparts in the Spirit Realm. You'll be fighting the same Cabal waves as before, but there are only three of you. Additionally, four War Councilors, each with their own symbol above their head, will spawn on the four plates. This is where communications with your teammates in the Spirit Realm becomes important. Each of the three Spirit Realm dwellers will see a different symbol displayed on Calus' head. They will individually call out the symbols that they see. One of the Punchers will then take a break from fighting Cabal to punch the Psion on the plate with only symbol your teammates didn't call out. For example, if Readers call "axe, cup, hound," someone will punch sun. This will kill them and allow your Spirit Realm Readers to progress. Do this three more times to enter the next phase of the fight.  Eventually, once the Readers have reached their end, Calus will begin channeling a giant ball of energy above his head. This will slowly deal damage to all those in the throne room. While he is doing this, he is covered in a glowing shield. The Punchers need to join forces and shoot Calus until his shield pops. Use a Healing Rift. Stand inside it. If your team is very high power, you can do this rather quickly. However, for reasons we'll explain shortly, you want this burn phase to go on for as long as possible without dying. Once he drops his orb, the Readers in the dark world will rejoin you, and it will be time to damage the boss. Readers in the Spirit Realm have a pretty simple job: crouch and hold back. After a few moments, ideally after the Punchers have left, Calus' giant head will begin sucking air into his mouth, pulling all the Readers to their deaths. However, there is a little purple bump on the ground. This will stop you from sliding forward and allow you to stay still. While the purple bump will not exist forever, it will keep you relatively safe for the moment. As Calus begins sucking in air, watch the center of his forehead. For each of the three Readers, Calus' head will show a different symbol. Select an order of Readers to call out their symbol and have each Reader call out what they see in order. This should be done as quickly as possible as it will help your Punchers determine who to punch. Once the Punchers have defeated the correct War Councilor, another purple bump will spawn a little ways down the slide. After about 15 seconds of him sucking in air, the first purple bump will disappear and you will begin sliding toward him. As long as the Punchers have done their job (meaning that you have also done yours), the new purple bump will catch you and hold you in place again. Read out the symbols just like last time. Repeat this until you reach the end. However, this section is far more complicated than that, because Readers have more to do than just read. After the symbols appear each time, a Psion Reflection will show up on the left and right side of the ramp. Kill these immediately. Otherwise, they will channel an ability that will wipe the raid instantly. Starting when the second symbol shows, three real Psions will also spawn, equipped with nasty, purple grenades that can lift you into the air, causing Calus' to suck you up. The strategy for dealing with these Psions takes a lot of practice, and even when you get it down, it is still a struggle.  As if the enemies weren't enough, the terrain itself is also trying to kill you. The first time through the Spirit Realm per encounter will have a relatively normal slide, aside from a few ramps here and there that will, of course, launch you into to Calus' mouth. However, the second time through and beyond, some of the stones will be removed, forcing you and your teammates to huddle up and shimmy as a unit. Movement is very difficult while sliding, so you must line yourself up before the barrier drops to ensure that you have smooth ground to ride on. If you have a ramp or hole in your way when you slide, the raid is likely over. 
Once you slide four times and read four times you will be very close to Calus' head. While there is no symbol this next time, the enemies still spawn. Get rid of the final Psions as quickly as possible and prepare to go skeet shooting. Calus' will begin vomiting skulls (yes, really) toward you and your allies. While this seems bad it is actually very good. For each skull that you kill, you will gain a stack of the Force of Will buff, which increases your damage against Calus drastically. 
Keep killing for as long as you can, getting your stacks higher and higher. Once the Punchers lower Calus' shield, he will stop vomiting in the Spirit Realm and a orb will spawn that can return you to the throne room. Grab the orb and head back. Now that all of you are together again, group up and, as six, jump onto the left plate that is closest to center — the axes plate. Be sure that each member is standing on the plate and drop everything you have: Warlock Empowered Rifts, Titan Rally Barricades, anything and everything that will help increase your teams damage.</p>
