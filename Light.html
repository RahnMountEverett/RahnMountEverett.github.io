				<h1>The BESTS plan to level in Destiny 2</h1>
				<p>As you all should know... leveling in Destiny 2 is a slow process as soon as you reach level 20 and 360 light. If you are not yet these levels its a simple fix. Progress through the story and do public events. These are by far the fastest way to level before you reach 360 light and are restricted when trying to gain more power. If you are a starting player the fastest way is to make two or maybe even three of the same class and to level them to twenty. As soon as you cant get anymore power from one character switch your gear to one of your other characters and do your milestones and etc. This will increase our power immensly.</p>

					<h3>260 Light and above</h3>
					<p>Make two of the same class and speedrun to level 20 then swap gear and do your milestones to boost your power fast in a short time. For even more success do it with three characters. With your main you should always buy each exotic from xur and by doubles for your other classes when they are made. For example buy two exotic helms for your titan from xur and send them throuh the app or the vault. You will upgrade a helemt on your titan with the exotic piece and boost your level fast.</p>

					<h3>Below level 20 and 260 light</h3>
					<p>The key to getting to level 20 is quite simple. Do your story mode and when your done or need to be a higher level... do public events. It takes around 3 heroics to get from level 19 to 20 and the rewards are generous. There is a link above that will take you to a public event guide to maximize your profit.</p>
