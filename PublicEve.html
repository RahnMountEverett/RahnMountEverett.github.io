				<h1>The BESTS plan to level in Destiny 2</h1>
				<p>As you all should know... leveling in Destiny 2 is a slow process as soon as you reach level 20 and 360 light. If you are not yet these levels its a simple fix. Progress through the story and do public events. These are by far the fastest way to level before you reach 360 light and are restricted when trying to gain more power. If you are a starting player the fastest way is to make two or maybe even three of the same class and to level them to twenty. As soon as you cant get anymore power from one character switch your gear to one of your other characters and do your milestones and etc. This will increase our power immensly.</p>

					<p>In this event, fallen ships will drop elite vandals around an area in which three drills are draining glimmer from the ground. After about five seconds of them spawning, another smaller drill will spawn. To activate the heroic, you must destroy this drill before killing the vandals and the captain at each station. Do this three times and ou will activate a control point filled with glimmer. protect this and you will have completed the heroic public event.</p>
